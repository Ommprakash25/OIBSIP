        <h3>Early years </h3>
        <p>
            ⦿ Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without
            receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
            Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a
            naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he
            struck out on his own.
        </p>
        <h3>Working at Edison</h3>
        <p>
            ⦿ In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[39] Tesla
            began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in
            large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société
            Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting
            system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering.
        </p>
        <h3>Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing</h3>
        <p>
            ⦿ Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,[58] possibly
            the same one he had developed at Edison.[44] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell,
            the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.[58] Serrell introduced Tesla
            to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and
            utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company.[59] Tesla worked for
            the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued
            to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey.[60] Tesla's new system
            gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.
        </p>
        <h3>AC and the induction motor</h3>
        <p>
            ⦿ In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles
            Fletcher Peck.[63] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents
            for financial gain.[64] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic
            motor idea,[65] they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed
            the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1⁄3
            to Tesla, 1⁄3 to Peck and Brown, and 1⁄3 to fund development.[64] They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89
            Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors,
            generators, and other devices.
        </p>
        <h3>Wireless power</h3>
        <p>
            ⦿ By the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance
            through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up
            a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab.[143][144][145] Seeming
            to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth's atmosphere was conductive,[146][147] he proposed a
            system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet
            (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions
            of volts) long distances.
        </p>
        <h3>Awards, patents and ideas</h3>
        <p>
        <h4>⦿ Tesla won numerous medals and awards over this time. They include:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava (Serbia, 1892)</li>
            <li>Elliott Cresson Medal (Franklin Institute, USA, 1894)[187]</li>
            <li>Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I (Montenegro, 1895)[188]</li>
            <li>AIEE Edison Medal (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, USA, 1916)[189]</li>
            <li>Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sava (Yugoslavia, 1926)[190]</li>
            <li>Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown (Yugoslavia, 1931)</li>

            <li>Order of the White Eagle (Yugoslavia, 1936)</li>
            <li>Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia, 1937)[191]</li>
            <li>Medal of the University of Paris (Paris, France, 1937)</li>
            <li>The Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida (Sofia, Bulgaria, 1939)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
            ⦿ On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was
            found by maid Alice Monaghan when she entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla
            had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled
            that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis (a type of heart attack).
